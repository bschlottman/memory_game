memory test

produces a line of text 4 random characters long that you must remember and provide the program with
after providing the correct sequence the program provides another line of characters that you must reiterate.
after the user returns the correct string to the program, the program will provide another line of 4 random characters, 
after 5 lines, memory.py will reduce the number of characters by 1, and after 10 lines, the string will be reduced to 2 characters. 
for each line the user remembers, the program will print a message: ‘Nice!, keep going:’ and will print 5 |’s on the line where the original string was, with the new string to remember underneath the string of pipes.
